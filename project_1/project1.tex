\section{Introduction}
Understanding the universe is one of the most fascinating challenges in science. Cosmology, the study of the universe as a whole, seeks to solve the mysteries of its origin, evolution, and fate. In this project, we explore cosmological models using observational supernovae data to extract key cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the deceleration parameter $q_0$. We also investigate different cosmological models and assess their fit to the data.
\vspace{-0.5cm}
\section{Theory}
Type Ia Supernovae are considered standardizable candles in cosmology due to their consistent brightness \cite{projpdf}. By measuring their apparent brightness and redshift $z$, we can infer distances and probe the expansion history of the universe. The distance modulus $\mu$ relates the apparent magnitude $m$ and absolute magnitude $M$ of a supernova,
\begin{equation}\label{d_L}
\mu = m - M = 5 \log_{10}(d_L) + 25,
\end{equation}
where $d_L$ is the luminosity distance in Mpc. In a flat universe, $d_L$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    d_L(z) = c(1 + z) \int_{0}^{z} \frac{dz^\prime}{H(z^\prime)},
\end{equation}
where $H$ is the Hubble parameter and $c$ the speed of light. In this case, the Friedmann equation reduces to $1 = \Omega_M + \Omega_\Lambda$, where $\Omega_M$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ are the matter and dark energy density parameters. By normalizing these with present values (subscript 0), one can get the reduced version of the so called $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
\begin{equation}\label{lCDM}
    H(z) = H_0 \sqrt{\Omega_{M,0}(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda,0}} \equiv H_0\,E(z)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}

For $z << 1$ (generally accepted to be $z < 0.5$), Taylor expansion gives of Eq. \ref{lCDM} leads to $E(z) \approx 1 + 2z\,(q_0 + 1)$, where $q_0 = (\Omega_{M,0} - 2\Omega_{\Lambda,0})/2$ is called the deceleration parameter, showing if the Universal expansion is decelerating ($q_0>0$) or accelerating ($q_0<0$). In the small-$z$ domain, $d_L$ can also be rewritten as 
\begin{equation}\label{small_z}
    d_L(z) = c(1+z)\int_{0}^{z}\frac{dz'}{H(z')} \approx \frac{c}{H_0}\left( z + \frac{1}{2}(1-q_0)z^2 + \dots \right).
\end{equation}

Other cosmologies can also be explored within the flat Universe. An extension to the flat $\Lambda$CDM is the so-called wCDM cosmology, which has the extra dark-energy equation-of-state parameter w, leading to a Hubble parameter corresponding to
\begin{equation}\label{wCDM}
    E(z) = \Omega_{M,0}(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda,0}(1+z)^{3(1+w)}.
\end{equation}
\vspace{-1.2cm}
\section{Methodology}
The first task was to infer values on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and deceleration parameter $q_0$ from provided supernova data using a Bayesian framework. The data consisted of redshift values $z$, observed distance moduli $\mu_{\text{obs}}$, and their associated uncertainties $\sigma_{\mu}$ for 833 Type Ia supernovae \cite{SCPwebsite}. Accordingly, log prior, log likelihood, and log posterior functions were defined. The prior distributions for $H_0$ and $q_0$ were chosen to be uniform within bounds based on prior knowledge from cosmological observations. We used $H_0 \in [30, 100]\,\si{\kilo\metre\per\second\per\mega\parsec}$ and $q_0 \in [-2, 2]$. For the unknown error variance parameter $s^2$, we used an inverse gamma prior with shape set to 1 and scale set to 1.

The likelihood function was constructed assuming Gaussian errors on the observed $\mu$,
\begin{equation}
    \ln \mathcal{L}(\mu_{\text{obs}} | H_0, q_0, s^2) = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} \left[ \frac{(\mu_{\text{obs},i} - \mu_{\text{model},i})^2}{\sigma_{\mu,i}^2s^2} + \ln(2\pi\sigma_{\mu,i}^2s^2) \right],
\end{equation}
where $\mu_{\text{model},i}$ is the model-predicted distance modulus from equation \ref{d_L} for the $i$-th supernova given parameters $H_0$ and $q_0$, and $\sigma_{\mu,i}$ is the observational uncertainty. To calculate $d_L$ using parameters $H_0$ and $q_0$, Eq. \ref{small_z} up to second order was used, as we only considered supernovae with $z < 0.5$. Following Bayes' theorem, the log posterior is then given by the sum of the log prior and log likelihood.

To sample the posterior distribution, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was employed using the \texttt{emcee} package \cite{emcee}. 50 walkers were initialized randomly within the prior bounds and run for 6000 iterations, discarding the first 1000 iterations as burn-in. Convergence was assessed by visually inspecting trace plots. After sampling, posterior distributions for $H_0$, $q_0$, and $s^2$, were analyzed. Corner plots using the \texttt{corner} package were created to visualize the joint and marginal posterior distributions of the parameters \cite{corner}. In addition to the posterior analysis, posterior predictive checks were performed to assess the model fit. Using the posterior samples and Eq. \ref{d_L} and \ref{small_z}, predicted distance moduli $\mu_{\text{model}}$ were generated across the original range of redshift values $z \in [0.1, 1.5]$, i.e., not only for small $z$, and compared to the observed data. %The median of the predicted distance moduli was plotted alongside the observed data in order to visually evaluate the model's performance.

The second part of the project focused on comparing the $\Lambda$CDM and wCDM cosmological models defined by the expressions for $H(z)$ in Eq. \ref{lCDM} and \ref{wCDM}. Due to the increased complexity when considering the full redshift range in Eq. \ref{small_z}, the models were compared using AIC and BIC scores. The log-likelihood function was modified to account for the whole redshift range, using the \texttt{scipy} package to perform the necessary numerical integration for $d_L(z)$ in Eq. \ref{small_z} \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}. The same package was used to optimize the log-likelihood function for both models, yielding maximum log-likelihood estimates for the parameters. The AIC and BIC scores were then calculated using the formulas
\begin{align}
    \text{AIC} &= 2\ln(\mathcal{L}^\star) - 2k \label{eq_AIC}\\
    \text{BIC} &= 2\ln(\mathcal{L}^\star) - k \ln(N) \label{eq_BIC},
\end{align}
where $k$ is the number of model parameters, $N$ the number of data points, and $\mathcal{L}^\star$ the maximum likelihood value. The model with the higher AIC and BIC scores was considered to have a better balance between fit quality and model complexity. In this case, we assumed that the overall variance was known and equal to the sample variance of the observed distance moduli. From the maximum likelihood estimates, we also found the matter and dark energy density parameters $\Omega_{M,0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}$ for both models. 

Finally, MCMC sampling was performed for the $\Lambda$CDM model to obtain the posterior distribution of $\Omega_{M,0}$. The same MCMC setup as before was used, however this time using 10 walkers and 1\,100 iterations due to the increased complexity, discarding the first 100 as burn-in. As above, we also considered the overall variance scale known in this case. For $H_0$, we fixed its value at 70 \si{\kilo\metre\per\second\per\mega\parsec}, and for $\Omega_{M,0}$, we used a uniform prior with values $\Omega_{M,0} \in [0, 1]$. The posterior samples were analyzed to derive credible intervals and visualize the marginal posterior distribution of $\Omega_{M,0}$.

\section{Results}
Fig.~\ref{fig:corner_plot} shows the joint and marginal posteriors for $H_0$, $q_0$, and $\sigma^2$, together with corresponding trace panels. The diagonal marginals are close to Gaussian, with posterior medians and 68\% credible intervals $H_0 = 69.79^{+0.42}_{-0.41}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, $q_0 = -0.419^{+0.068}_{-0.070}$, and $\sigma^2 = 0.968^{+0.034}_{-0.032}$. The negative $q_0$ indicates accelerated expansion, and a $\sigma^{2}$ near unity indicates that the quoted uncertainties require no overall rescaling. The contours reveal a clear negative correlation between $H_0$ and $q_0$ (meaning that as $H_0$ increases, we have a stronger present-day cosmic acceleration, i.e., lower $q_0$) and only weak coupling of $\sigma^2$ to the other parameters. The trace panels are stationary and show rapid mixing, consistent with adequate burn-in removal and stable sampling.

Fig.~\ref{fig:posterior_predictive} displays the Hubble diagram: distance modulus $\mu$ versus redshift $z$ for the supernova data together with the small-$z$ model curve $\mu(z<0.5;H_0,q_0)$ evaluated using the posterior median parameters from Fig.~\ref{fig:corner_plot}. The curve follows the data closely for $z\lesssim 0.5$ and exhibits the gentle upward curvature expected for $q_0<0$. For $z\gtrsim 0.5$ systematic departures between the second-order model and the points become apparent, reflecting the limited validity of the small-$z$ expansion at higher redshift. The vertical scatter of the low-$z$ points about the curve is comparable to the quoted uncertainties, consistent with the inferred variance scale $\sigma^{2}\simeq 1$.

Using the full redshift range with $H_0=70\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ to compare the two flat models, $\Lambda$CDM and wCDM, yields very similar maximum-likelihood estimates ($\Omega_{M,0}\approx 0.28$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda,0}\approx 0.72$), see Table~\ref{tab_IC}. The fitted $w$ is essentially $-1$, making wCDM consistent with $\Lambda$CDM within the precision of this dataset. The AIC and BIC values in Table~\ref{tab_IC} are slightly higher for $\Lambda$CDM, favoring the simpler model. This is consistent with the wCDM fit settling at $w\approx -1$ while introducing an additional parameter.

The marginal posterior for $\Omega_{M,0}$ under flat $\Lambda$CDM (known measurement variances) peaks near the maximum-likelihood value reported in Table~\ref{tab_IC}, providing a consistent central estimate around $\Omega_{M,0}\approx 0.28$. The distribution is tight and symmetric, indicating the full-redshift data constrain $\Omega_{M,0}$ well. The posterior mass lies well away from the boundaries $\Omega_{M,0}=0$ and $1$, and the mode and median are in close agreement with the best-fit value. Sampler traces have clearly converged, indicating adequate mixing and stable estimates.

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
The corner plot shows an accelerating universe with a decisively negative $q_0$ (median $-0.419$). The estimate for $H_0$ is $69.79~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, which is in the expected $\sim 70$ range, and the variance scale is close to unity ($\sigma^2=0.968$), which supports the overall calibration of the uncertainties. A very-low-$z$ Hubble-law check gives $H_0 = 68.31 \pm 5.75~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. This agrees with the small-$z$ posterior and the larger error bar is consistent with peculiar-velocity scatter and the omission of the quadratic term in that limit.

The Hubble diagram behaves as expected. The second-order small-$z$ model $\mu(z; H_0, q_0)$ tracks the data well for $z\lesssim 0.5$ and shows the gentle upward curvature implied by $q_0<0$. At higher redshift the approximation starts to miss structure in the data, which is natural once the series is pushed beyond its intended range.

Over the full redshift range, the best-fit matter densities are $\Omega_{M,0}=0.278$ for flat $\Lambda$CDM and $0.281$ for flat wCDM. These values essentially match the Supernova Cosmology Project results for the same dataset reported by Suzuki et al.\ ($0.277$ and $0.281$), which indicates that the distance–redshift model, weighting, and optimizer are behaving as intended for central estimates. With $w\simeq -1$, wCDM offers no meaningful improvement over $\Lambda$CDM. The information criteria therefore prefer the simpler model, as the slight increase in fit is offset by the complexity penalty, helping to avoid overfitting.
